### How is it used?
We use Shelly to develop our internal tooling for SharePoint which is, more or less, all about small WinForms based desktop applications.
Also, we use [metroframework-modern-ui](https://github.com/dennismagno/metroframework-modern-ui) implementation for [MetaPack GUI](https://github.com/SubPointSolutions/MetaPack).
Currently, this project will be enhanced and updated as per our need with minimal documentation but you are welcome to give us a shout creating a new issue, suggestion or documentation. We'll work it out for you.
